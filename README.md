1. Frontend: TodoPage Component
Original Task:
You asked for the implementation of the delete and save task functionality. Additionally, you wanted the button state to update based on whether the task name was modified.

What I Did:
Implemented delete functionality:

The handleDelete function uses the API to delete a task and refreshes the task list.
Attached the handleDelete function to the Delete button.


Implemented save functionality:

The handleSave function updates a task if its name was changed. It uses api.put to update tasks.
Added state management to track whether a task name has changed and conditionally enabled/disabled the "Save" button (Check icon).
Tracked changes for each task:

Used a taskChanges state object to keep track of the modified names for individual tasks.
Ensured the Check button is only enabled when a task name is changed.

Added a placeholder for creating new tasks (handleAddTask), which you can extend as needed.

Key Additions:
Dynamic Button State:

Save (Check button) is only enabled when the task name differs from its original value.
Controlled Input Field:

Text input dynamically updates the state for task changes.
API Integration:

Used api.delete and api.put for task deletion and updates.


2. Backend: TaskController Class
Original Task:
You provided a TaskController class and asked to implement the create and update endpoints following the pattern of existing methods.

What I Did:
Implemented the create method:

Used SaveTaskUseCase to handle the logic for creating tasks.
Passed the SaveTaskDto to the use case for data processing.
Implemented the update method:

Used UpdateTaskUseCase for updating existing tasks.
Extracted the id from the route parameters and passed it along with the SaveTaskDto to the use case.
Followed the dependency injection pattern:

Ensured UseCaseFactory dynamically creates and provides the required use cases (SaveTaskUseCase and UpdateTaskUseCase).
Key Additions:
create Method:

Calls SaveTaskUseCase to save new tasks.
update Method:

Calls UpdateTaskUseCase to handle updates.
Converts the route parameter id to a number for proper type safety.


3. Backend: TaskRepository Class
Original Task:
You provided a TaskRepository class and asked for the implementation of the save method using Prisma.

What I Did:
Implemented the save method:
Handles both task creation and updating using Prisma API.
Check if the id is provided:
If id is absent: Creates a new task using prisma.task.create.
If id is present: Updates the task using prisma.task.update.

Task Creation:

Used prisma.task.create with the data provided for new tasks.
Task Update:

Used prisma.task.update with where and data to update existing tasks.
Type Safety:

Ensured compatibility with Prisma input types (TaskCreateInput and TaskUpdateInput) using Prisma.XOR.
"""
repository.save({ name: 'New Task', description: 'Description' });

repository.save({ id: 1, name: 'Updated Name' });
"""

4. Backend: SaveTaskUseCase Class
Original Task:
You provided a skeleton for the SaveTaskUseCase class and requested implementation for:

DTO Validation
Data Saving
Error Handling
What I Did:
Validated the SaveTaskDto:

Ensured the name field is not empty.
Added a simple validation check before proceeding with saving.
Handled saving:

Passed the SaveTaskDto to the TaskRepository.save method.
TaskRepository dynamically determines whether to create or update based on the presence of an id.
Added error handling:

Caught and logged errors from the repository layer.
Re-threw user-friendly error messages for higher-level consumption.
Key Additions:
Validation:

Checked if name is provided and non-empty.
Can be extended with more sophisticated validation rules.
Task Repository Integration:

Used TaskRepository.save to persist data.
Error Handling:

Caught and logged repository-level errors for debugging.
Re-threw user-friendly errors to the caller.

Saving a task:
"""
useCase.handle({ name: 'New Task' });

useCase.handle({ id: 1, name: 'Updated Task' });
"""
